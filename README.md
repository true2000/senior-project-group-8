# senior-project-group-8

## Introduction:
This project aims to develop a content-based filtering approach for a movie recommendation system, focusing on utilizing movie attributes to address scenarios given by the user. The gathered attributes such as genre, rating, actors and more will come from a diverse dataset. Some feature vectors representing these attributes will allow for similarity computations between movies by using metrics like cosine similarity. From a search the top-N most related movies will be recommended. The frameworks that will be using for machine learning are PyTorch for the backend API it will be Flask, while for the frontend we will utilise React. 

## Technology Stack:

### Machine Learning:
As mentioned we will be using PyTorch to create the model for this project, the main reason that we decided to use it is it's easier to prototype a model quickly with multiple changes and provides an easy transition. Ontop of this it is has a lower skill floor to learning compared to other models that we considered such as Tensor Flow. 

### Frontend
